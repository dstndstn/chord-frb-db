class BeamGrouper(Actor):
    """
    The purpose of this class is to group together L1 events detected in
    different beams that were presumably caused by a common incident pulse.
    These multibeam detections may arise from very bright astrophysical bursts
    as well as near-field RFI.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t_thr, dm_thr, ra_thr, dec_thr : float
        Thresholds in ms, pc cm :sup:`-3`, and beam separation
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional parameters are used to initialize superclass
        (``ActorBaseClass``).

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    A group is defined as a number of L1 events where, for any event in
    the group, there exists another event whose differences in DM, time,
    RA, and Dec are all below the specified thresholds.

    The grouping is done with the DBSCAN algorithm :sup:`[1,2]`. To use this
    method, we need to first define what a *distance* between different events
    means.  To do this, we first scale the aforementioned axes by dividing the
    values by the relevant thresholds. We then apply the Chebyshev metric
    :sup:`[3]` to get a meaningful distance. The above group definition now
    ensures that, for every event in a group, there exists another event such
    that the *distance* between them is less than 1.
